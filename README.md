# C++ Programming & Data Structures Repository

This repository contains my **structured learning journey in C++ programming**, covering **core fundamentals, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Standard Template Library (STL), Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and mini projects**.

All programs are written from scratch with a focus on **logic clarity, clean structure, and consistent practice**.

- Writing multiple student records
- File-based student database programs

---

### 🔹 Mini Projects
- Calculator (Function-based)
- Distance Converter (Menu-driven)
- Student Result System (Structures)
- Student Database System (File Handling)
- OOP-based Student Management System

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Start from **core fundamentals**
- Write code manually (no blind copy-paste)
- Debug and fix mistakes independently
- Maintain **clean folder structure**
- Follow **one concept → one commit**
- Continuously revise and refactor

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Strengthening **DSA foundations**
- Improving **problem-solving ability**
- Building **internship-ready projects**
- Maintaining **consistent GitHub contributions**

---

## 🚀 Roadmap Ahead

- Advanced Array Techniques (Prefix Sum, Subarrays)
- Linked Lists
- Stack & Queue (DSA implementation)
- Trees & Graphs
- Larger real-world projects
- Hybrid Software + Embedded projects

---

## 📌 Note

This repository reflects **learning progress, discipline, and consistency**, not just final results.

---

**Consistency. Fundamentals. Growth.**
